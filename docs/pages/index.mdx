# Introduction

Mod is a standard for creating mini apps. Mod currently only supports the Farcaster protocol, and Miniapps can be one of two kinds: Miniapps for creating content, or Miniapps for displaying embeds.
Mod Miniapps are currently defined via a JSON configuration file, and are reviewed and approved into the registry on a case by case basis to ensure security, performance and quality.

## Design goals

User Experience is the most important design goal considered while designing Mod.
The key drivers of UX for Mod are: Consistency, Simplicity, Security, Speed and Feature-rich integrations.

## Roadmap

Mod's goal is to become a sustainable internet public good, as a protocol.

Mod plans to support other decentralized protocols natively, move the storage of Miniapps to decentralized technologies and support richer APIs, such that Miniapps can hook into the full lifecycle of an app.

Mod may make it possible for future Miniapp creators to token gate access to Miniapps, as well as the ability for creators to earn a share of transactions facilitated by their Miniapps.
