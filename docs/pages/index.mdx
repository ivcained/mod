# Introduction

Mod is a standard for creating mini apps. Mod currently only supports the Farcaster protocol, and Mini-apps can be one of two kinds: Mini-apps for creating content, or Mini-apps for displaying embeds.
Mod Mini-apps are currently defined via a JSON configuration file, and are reviewed and approved into the registry on a case by case basis to ensure security, performance and quality.

## Why?

## Design goals

User Experience is the most important design goal considered while designing Mod.
The key drivers of UX for Mod are: Consistency, Simplicity, Security, Speed and Feature-rich integrations.

## Roadmap

Mod's goal is to become a sustainable internet public good, as a protocol.

Mod plans to support other decentralized protocols natively, move the storage of Mini-apps to decentralized technologies and support richer APIs, such that Mini-apps can hook into the full lifecycle of an app.

Mod may make it possible for future Miniapp creators to token gate access to Mini-apps, as well as the ability for creators to earn a share of transactions facilitated by their Mini-apps.
