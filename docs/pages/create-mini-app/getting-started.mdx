# Getting started making a Miniapp

A Miniapp is just a JSON file. Part of this JSON is the manifest, defining things like the version and name, and other parts
are the elements rendered by the Miniapp, like a text or an image.

Our convention is to write Miniapps in TypeScript, for better autocompletion and legibility, with the mini-apps being built to JSON.
You can take a look inside the `/miniapps` folder of [this repo](https://github.com/mod-protocol/mod) to see how miniapps work

## Why does Mod protocol use configuration files and not React components?

Miniapps that are displayed within feeds need to be secure, performant and consistent in design.
This is harder to achieve with React Components, and also restricts Mod protocol to only projects that use React.

## Steps to make a new Miniapp

1. Fork [this repo](https://github.com/mod-protocol/mod)
2. Create a new miniapp by duplicating an existing one in `/miniapps` or creating a new folder
3. Name your miniapp consistently between the folder name and the `slug` in the `manifest.ts` file
4. Create the elements of your miniapp
5. Add your miniapp to `/packages/miniapp-registry/src/index.ts`
6. Submit a Pull request
