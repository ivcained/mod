# FAQ

## Can I integrate the mini apps using my own editor?

Yes

## Is there a way to use this without using React?

Not at the moment, but multiple library support will come eventually. Requests on what you'd like to be supported is helpful, please contact david at modprotocol.org.
There may be bounties available to implement a library.

## React-native support?

Coming soon. There's an open draft Pull Request for this. Help wanted!

## Why does Mod protocol use configuration files and not React components?

Mini-apps that are displayed within feeds need to be secure, performant and consistent in design.
This is harder to achieve with React Components, and also restricts Mod protocol to only projects that use React.
