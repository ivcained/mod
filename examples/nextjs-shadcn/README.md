## Getting Started

Copy `.env.example` to a new file called `.env` in this directory. In order for this example to work, it depends on the backend in `../api` at port `3001` to be running. You can do this by navigating to `../api` and following the `README` there to run the server.

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
